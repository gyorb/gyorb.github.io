      <description>CodeChecker With CodeChecker we created a tool to view and manage the results found by multiple static analyzers like Clang Static Analyzer and Clang Tidy.
You can check your C/C++ project easily and filter/view the results on a web interface or in the command line. With the command line interface integration to the Continous Integration loops can be done easily.</description>

      <description>In this post I will introduce my current Hugo setup. I will show you how I configured the git repositories, how I write new posts and how easy it is to publish the generated site on GitHub pages. With a static site generator like Hugo it is really easy to create a blogging environment where your posts and your site is version controlled and stored in git.
Why I&#39;ve changed my first setup I&#39;ve tried to use one git repository for the generated site and for the posts in markdown together.</description>
