      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;rsquo;ve collected some tips to harden the default &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openssh.com/&#34;&gt;OpenSSH&lt;/a&gt;
configuration on an Ubuntu LTS server. SSH protocol is usually used to connect to a remote machine securely.
There are a lot of configuration options which can be used to make a server
more secure. Disabling some features can help too if they are not needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using fzf to quick access my notes from the cli</title>

      <description>I wanted to create a simple script to quickly access my notes from the command line. fzf is a great and flexible tool which can be used to fuzzy search in the given input, like the file names in my notes directory. I already use it to search in the command line history and in vim to open files with fzf.vim. In this post I will walk you through how I built my note script using fzf.</description>

      <title>My Hugo setup for GitHub pages</title>

      <description>In this post I will introduce my current Hugo setup. I will show you how I configured the git repositories, how I write new posts and how easy it is to publish the generated site on GitHub pages. With a static site generator like Hugo it is really easy to create a blogging environment where your posts and your site is version controlled and stored in git.
Why I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my first setup I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to use one git repository for the generated site and for the posts in markdown together.</description>
